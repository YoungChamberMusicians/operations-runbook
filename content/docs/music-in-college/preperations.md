# How to Prepare for the *Music in College* Talk/Panel

The *Music in College* talk/panel is an event series hosted by Young Chamber Musicians (YCM) where YCM students hear from YCM alumni about their experiences in college or conservatory programs. Alumni share their perspectives and answer questions from current students. This guide will walk you through the preparation process step by step.

## Overview

The panel typically consists of:

- **Three YCM alumni**
- **One moderator**

The director will initiate contact with the panelists and moderator, and the executive assistant will coordinate the event. The director will also provide an optimal date range for the event. Ideally, you should have at least **6-8 weeks** to plan and execute the event.

## 4-6 Weeks Before the Event


1. **Identify Potential Dates**:
   - Work with the director to determine a range of possible dates for the event. These dates are typically near the end of semesters.

2. **Use a Scheduling Tool**:
   - Use a tool like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) to find a date that works for all panelists and the moderator.
     - Create a Doodle poll with the proposed dates.
     - Share the poll with the panelists and moderator and ask them to vote for their preferred dates.

3. **Confirm the Date**:
   - Once a date is agreed upon, confirm it with all participants.

## 2 Weeks Before the Event


1. **Schedule a Meeting**:
   - Set up a meeting with the moderator and panelists to discuss the event. This meeting can be held virtually (e.g., via Google Meet).

2. **Discuss Topics and Format**:
   - During the meeting, discuss the topics that will be covered during the panel.
   - Explain the event format to the panelists and answer any questions they may have.

3. **Confirm Recording Consent**:
   - Ask the panelists if they are comfortable with the event being recorded and posted (as an unlisted video) on YouTube for the YCM community.

4. **Request Bios and Headshots**:
   - Ask each panelist to provide a short bio (2-3 sentences) and a headshot for promotional materials.

5. **Create a Google Meet Link**:
   - Create a Google Meet link for the event:
     - Open Google Calendar and create a new event for the panel date.
     - Click **"Add Google Meet video conferencing"** to generate a meeting link.
     - Share the event details (including the Google Meet link) with the panelists and moderator.

6. **Review the Runsheet**:
   - Share an example runsheet with the moderator and panelists to give them an idea of how the event will flow.
