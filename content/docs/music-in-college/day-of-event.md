# Day of the Event: *Music in College* Panel


## Important Note About Meeting Space

Because the panel is recorded, you need a reliable way to capture the event. Here are the options:

1. **Google Meet Recording**:
   - The easiest method is to use Google Meet’s built-in recording feature. However, the **non-profit edition of Google Workspace does not allow recording**. If this is still the case, consider sending a polite but firm email to Google requesting an upgrade for single accounts to a higher tier that includes recording capabilities.

2. **Zoom Recording**:
   - Zoom allows recording, but free accounts have a **40-minute time limit**. To avoid interruptions, you may need to purchase a Zoom subscription for the event.

3. **OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)**:
   - OBS is a free, open-source program for recording and streaming. However, it requires additional setup:
     - Download and install OBS from [obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com/).
     - Configure OBS to record the meeting by rerouting the audio to capture the computer’s output.
     - Test OBS thoroughly before the event to ensure it works correctly.

## 30 Minutes Before the Event

1. **Join the Meeting Early**:
   - Sign in to the chosen platform (Google Meet, Zoom, or OBS) **30 minutes before the event**.
   - Test the following:
     - **Microphone**: Ensure all participants can be heard clearly.
     - **Camera**: Check that video feeds are working properly.
     - **Recording**: Confirm that the recording setup is functioning.

2. **Welcome Panelists and Moderator**:
   - Ask the panelists and moderator to join the meeting early for a quick tech check.
   - Verify that their microphones and cameras are working.

3. **Director’s Introduction**:
   - If the director is attending, they may join at the beginning to introduce the event and the moderator.

4. **Set Up a Question Feed**:
   - Use the **"Ask a Question"** feature in Google Meet or a **private chat** in Zoom to collect questions from the audience.
   - Inform the audience how to submit questions (e.g., “Please use the ‘Ask a Question’ feature in Google Meet to submit your questions.”).

## Event Start

1. **Start the Recording**:
   - Double-check that the recording has started. If using OBS, ensure the program is actively recording.

2. **Monitor the Chat for Questions**:
   - Keep an eye on the chat or question feed for audience questions.
   - Relay relevant questions to the moderator at appropriate times, especially if they are not already on the agenda.

3. **Follow the Runsheet**:
   - Keep the event on schedule by gently reminding the moderator of time limits for each segment. A quick reminder in the private chat for 30 minutes, 15 minutes, and 5 minutes is helpful. 

## During the Event

1. **Feed Questions to the Moderator**:
   - As questions come in, send them to the moderator via private chat or another discreet method.
   - Ensure the moderator addresses questions in a timely and organized manner.

2. **Monitor Technical Issues**:
   - Watch for any technical problems (e.g., audio/video glitches) and address them quickly.
   - If using OBS, ensure the recording is still running smoothly.
