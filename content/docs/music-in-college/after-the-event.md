# After the Event: *Music in College* Panel

This guide outlines the steps to take after the *Music in College* panel has concluded. It includes thanking participants, editing and uploading the video, and organizing event documents for future reference.


## Thank Participants

1. **Send a Thank-You Email**:
   - Draft an email to the moderator and panelists thanking them for their time and participation.
   - Example Email:

## Edit the Video

1. **Use DaVinci Resolve**:
   - Open the recording in **DaVinci Resolve**.
   - Trim any unnecessary sections, such as pre-event setup or post-event chatter.

2. **Remove Personal Information**:
   - If the panelists shared their email addresses or other personal information at the end of the event, ensure this is cut from the video before uploading.

3. **Export the Edited Video**:
   - Once editing is complete, export the video in a high-quality format (e.g., MP4).


## Step 3: Upload the Video to YouTube

1. **Log in to YouTube**:
   - Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) and log in using the YCM account credentials.

2. **Upload the Video**:
   - Click the **Create** button (camera icon with a "+" sign) and select **Upload Video**.
   - Drag and drop the edited video file or select it from your computer.

3. **Set Video Privacy**:
   - Set the video privacy to **Unlisted** so that only people with the link can view it.

4. **Add to Playlist**:
   - Add the video to the **Music in College** playlist on the YCM YouTube channel.

5. **Add a Title and Description**:
   - Use a clear and descriptive title, such as:
     ```
     *Music in College* Panel - [Month Year]
     ```
   - Include a brief description of the event and list the panelists and moderator.

     ```
     Example: `2023-10-15-Music in College Panel`

2. **Add Files to the Folder**:
   - Upload the following documents to the folder:
     - **Run Sheet**: The document used to guide the event.
     - **Background Images**: Any images used during the event (e.g., panelist headshots, promotional graphics).
     - **Edited Video File**: The final version of the video uploaded to YouTube.
