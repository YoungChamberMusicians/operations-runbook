Subject: Information about your new student YCM account 

Hello and Welcome to Young Chamber Musicians!

My name is Kyle Baldwin, and I am the Executive Assistant for Young Chamber Musicians (YCM).

This email serves as an introduction or a reminder to the technology YCM uses to connect with both students and parents. This allows YCM to communicate and share information across Young Chamber Musicians more efficiently and securely. Please know that in addition to the below information, any general information and announcements will always be copied to the parents email address(es) on file. If needed, parents may access YCM folders and info using your young musician’s email address. If you have any questions or problems, please feel free to reach out to me.

All new students should have received a username and password that must be used to access YCM assets. Current students should use the same login information as last year. The email will have come from my email (ea@youngchambermusicians.org) and within the last hour. The services we are utilizing are provided by Google Workspace. Because of this, many of them will be familiar to you.

Email: You have been given a students.youngchambermusicians.org email address that will be the official way to communicate YCM business. This should be checked regularly. Your email can be accessed at mail.google.com
