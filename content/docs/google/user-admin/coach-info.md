Hi new coach! 

You should have received a username and password that must be used to access YCM assets. (It will have been from Google, not my email address.) We utilize Google's workspace which may be familiar to you already.

Drive

Your YCM drive has been setup to provide you with important files quickly. You can access it by navigating to drive.google.com
<https://drive.google.com>. On the left side of the browser window, you will see shared Drives. In this shared drive folder you
should see the following drives:

-  *Coaches*: This drive has the files that you access regularly including roster, ensemble list, ensemble schedule, ensemble repertoire, and the coaching report form. 

- *Library*: This drive is YCM's digital library and contains all of the collected and purchased digital sheet music that YCM keeps.

- *Ensembles*: This drive contains all of the ensembles' files including their biographies and masterclass videos. While I don't anticipate you spending much time in these folders, this allows you to share media with specific ensembles that will only be visible to that ensemble. (e.g., you could take a recording of a run through at the end of rehearsal and then easily put that video in the ensembles's folder for them to access.)

Email

All official announcements from YCM will be sent to your YCM email and all YCM communications to students should come from this address. You can access your web mail at mail.google.com <https:://mail.google.com>.

Calendar

All YCM events and coachings can be found on your YCM calendar. The calendar can be found at calendar.google.com. When you log in, you should see three calendars on the left side. There will be your personal YCM calendar, the Events calendar, and the Coaching Schedule calendar.

The Events calendar has concerts and masterclasses. The Coaching Schedule has all of the weekly coachings. This year we are trying to use this calendaring system to schedule the coaches as well. By doing this, any coaching you are added (invited) to will also appear on your personal calendar automatically. This should make things easier for the coaches to see if/who/when they are coaching for the day/week/month etc.

What next?

Please take a second and look around. Don't be shy! You shouldn't be able to break anything. (And if you do, it's fixable!) If you don't see something, please let me know. 

Susan would like to include your photo/bio on our website. (https://www.youngchambermusicians.org/team) If you could please direct me to a short biography of yourself along with a headshot, that would be greatly appreciated. 

I am looking forward to working with you this season! Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any problems with the above information or have additional questions.

All the best,
