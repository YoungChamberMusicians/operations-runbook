# YCM Operations Runbook 

This document serves as an overview of operational duties that are done throughout 
the year as well as instructions on how to accomplish them. In general, they are grouped 
in a way that shows operational procedure and not asset location. For instance, 
masterclasses have elements of using the Zeffy and YCM sites, but are grouped under 
masterclass because of the operational process.
